# Configuration module that set some useful variables to detect OS, compiler
# and compiler architecture

# It defines the following variables:
#  OS => Windows - Microsoft Windows
#        OSX     - Mac OSX
#        Linux   - Linux OS
#        FreeBSD - FreeBSD OS
#  COMPILER => MSVC  - Microsoft Visual C++
#              MinGW - MinGW compiler
#              Clang - Clang compiler
#              GCC   - GNU Compiler Collection
#  COMPILER_ARCH => It could be 64 or 32
